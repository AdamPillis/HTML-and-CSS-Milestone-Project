# Wild Atlantic Golf (will include link to official website)
## 
### What
Wild Atlantic Golf is an *Informative Website* purely built to **provide** information to it's users free of charge.
It is a golf related website built by a software developer who takes a great interest in this particular sport. He lives 
on the West coast of Ireland which means he is not new within the area and he knows what would interest its "potential
online visitors". The website is filled with quality images showing off the landscape so overall, it will enhance the 
level of tourism for this part of Ireland. 
### How 
The website first offers some reasons *why the user should stay on the site just under the main image with the hopes to
catch the user's eye by providing a list of reasons and surely, one may enough to convince the user with the main above it.
This section is followed by another "information section" if the user is convinced about the entire west coast of Ireland and 
what golf opportunities exist in this particular area along with ideas like hotels and restaurants if the user would want
to make a family holiday out of it. 
The second page is the main concept of the website where the **key information** is provided for the user. The golf courses are
briefly described with a large image on the side to enhance their imagination. 
The third page offers the user to type some personal information to receive news about updates to come which is a major plan 
for the developer in the future. 
### Who
The target audience is **world-wide**. There are over *65 million* golfers around the world so the target market is around this 
number. Most of these will more than likely have families so by providing information about *staying and dining* only increases 
the original target audience.
