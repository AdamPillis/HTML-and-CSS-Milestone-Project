# Wild Atlantic Golf (will include link to official website)

## 1. **Introduction**

### **What**
Wild Atlantic Golf is an *Informative Website* purely built to **provide** information to it's users free of charge.
It is a golf related website built by a software developer who takes a great interest in this particular sport. He lives 
on the West coast of Ireland which means he is not new within the area and he knows what would interest its "potential
online visitors". The fact that he is surrounded by some world-class courses within a 40 km radius gave him the first 
'spark'. The website is filled with quality images showing off the landscape so overall, it will enhance the 
level of tourism for this part of Ireland. 

### **How**
The website first offers some reasons *why the user should stay on the site just under the main image with the hopes to
catch the user's eye by providing a list of reasons and surely, one may enough to convince the user with the main above it.
This section is followed by another "information section" if the user is convinced about the entire west coast of Ireland and 
what golf opportunities exist in this particular area along with ideas like hotels and restaurants if the user would want
to make a family holiday out of it. 
The second page is the main concept of the website where the **key information** is provided for the user. The golf courses are
briefly described with a large image on the side to enhance their imagination. 
The third page offers the user to type some personal information to receive news about updates to come which is a major plan 
for the developer in the future. 

### **Who**
The target audience is **world-wide**. There are over *65 million* golfers around the world so the target market is around this 
number. Most of these will more than likely have families so by providing information about *staying and dining* only increases 
the original target audience.

**New User**: The idea behind this website is to attract local and international golfers to the West Coast of Ireland. For first time users, the reason why they would land on this page is find out information regarding golf courses along the Wild Atlantic Way. Therefore, on the landing page, they would find key regarding the area and its accessibility. However, the main informative page is the course.html given that it provides images and a description of each course and this is why buttons linked to course.html are located all over the landing page. It is optional for each new user to sign up by entering their email address if they wish to return as exisiting users.

**Existing User**: There are over 40 links golf courses on the Western Region so the developer's future plan is to extend the site by adding more pages and four *new golf courses* to the *course.html* every month. By signing up, the new user will be notified after updates have taken place and they can return to the site with a matter of a click to check out the updates.
