                    <p class="course-p">Officially established in 1892, Lahinch Golf Club owns one of the <strong>oldest</strong> links golf courses. 
                       The mesmerising fairways surrounded by medium-sized sand dunes and exceptional greens will surely challenge 
                       any enthusiast golfer.. not to mention the strength of the Wild Atlantic Way when it comes to weather conditions.
                       The golf club consists of 36 holes, the New Course and the Old Course. The Old Course was originally designed 
                       by Old Tom Morris over 100 years ago and yet, untouched ever since!
                       This golf course held the "Dubai Duty Free Irish Open" in 2019 so it is surely among the top golf courses world-wide!
