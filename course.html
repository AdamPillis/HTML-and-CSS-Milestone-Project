                    <p class="course-p">Officially established in 1892, Lahinch Golf Club owns one of the <strong>oldest</strong> links golf courses. 
                       The mesmerising fairways surrounded by medium-sized sand dunes and exceptional greens will surely challenge 
                       any enthusiast golfer.. not to mention the strength of the Wild Atlantic Way when it comes to weather conditions.
                       The golf club consists of 36 holes, the New Course and the Old Course. The Old Course was originally designed 
                       by Old Tom Morris over 100 years ago and yet, untouched ever since!
                       This golf course held the "Dubai Duty Free Irish Open" in 2019 so it is surely among the top golf courses world-wide!

                        <p class="course-p">The landscape attracted three American businessmen origionally in the early 90s and the golf 
                            club officially opened in 2002. The first shot ever taken was by its own course designer, Greg Norman
                            who most certainly made use of those large sand dunes, as seen on the image. The 18 hole championship course stretches along
                            a four mile Wild Coast beach in the shape of the letter 'D'. The Trump Organisation purchased the course
                            off the original owners back in 2014 and have since invested over €5m into the course to enable golfers to have an 
                            unforgetable experience.
                            This course will surely challenge your golfing skills in the wind, unless you're lucky enough to play on a fine day.

                        <p class="course-p">Ballybunion lies along the high coast of Co. Kerry with its golf courses consisting
                            of 36 links holes. The <strong><u>Old Course</u></strong> was established in the early 1900s but stayed "unnoticed"
                            until the 1980s, when Tom Watson discovered this hidden beauty and designed the <strong><u>New Course</u></strong>.
                            This golf club offers two spectacular courses in their pure, natural form with some of the highest sand dunes 
                            existing world-wide along the wild Atlantic Ocean. The greens lie hign and low with fairways in muscular shapes and surrounded 
                            by the well-known sand dunes. <br>
                            It's longest par 3 stretches 214 yards, you think you can get a 'Birdie'?

                    <p class="course-p">
                            Waterville golf club was established as early as 1889 and has become one of the very first golf courses registered 
                            in Ireland in the early 1900s. The golf course sits on the far side of the Ring of Kerry and the scenery is filled with high 
                            mountains far away and the wild atlantic. The opening-hole's name is '<strong>Last Easy</strong>' so be ready for what this perfect links course
                            is going to throw at you during your visit. The rugged style high fairways will block any golfer's view when teeing off
                            but don't worry, the tee boxes are raised for this matter. However, you're biggest challenge will be the big sand dunes which 
                            surround the green so make sure to give yourself enough time to look for your ball!
